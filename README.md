# PokerProbabilities
This passion project is to help me better estimate and understand poker probabilities. 
It simulates hundreds of opponent hands and community cards, against your given hand to give you a probability estimate of winning.
Running PokerGUI will run a tkinter program in which you can select the cards in your hand and as they arrive on the board, and then click calculate to determine the chances of winning.
This does not input any knowledge about opponent bets, and does not tell you the most optimal play to run. It only helps you understand your chances of winning. You should play the odds but play them carefully.
