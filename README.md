# PokerProbabilities
This passion project is to help me better estimate and understand poker probabilities. 
It simulates thousands of opponent hands, against your given hand to give you a probability estimate of winning.
The code to evaluate a hand is rather complex, and hope to add some docstrings and commenting to improve readability. 
You may rerun the code when the flop, turn, and river come to update the probability estimates.
